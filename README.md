# Bible-Fillion
A VPL and a BBLI file, of the Fillion bible, extracted from La Porte Latine, and converted by me for eSword.

I am doing this for free, unsponsored, for public interest.

La Porte Latine (laportelatine.org) is considered a trusted source for the Fillion Bible because it is the official website of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X (FSSPX) in France, a Catholic organization dedicated to preserving traditional liturgy and doctrine. They publish the Sainte Bible translated by Abbé Louis-Claude Fillion directly from the Vulgate, which was the Church’s officially approved Latin text at the Council of Trent. This makes their digital edition both authoritative and aligned with Catholic tradition

The Fillion bible is part of the public domain. You can redistribute, copy and modify the modules.

The Fillion bible BBLI module that is currently available on Biblesupport.com contains errors. It is missing a complete paragraph, and it does not cite it's source (where the Fillion bible text was taken from (crosswire? eBible? other?)) and does not explain the processing and modifications made upon it. That is why I started a new module from scratch, from the .epub file at laportelatine.org.

Process
=======
I downloaded the .epub file, (https://laportelatine.org/medias/ebooks-livres-numeriques/la-sainte-bible-l-c-fillion) and renamed the .epub to a .ZIP file, then proceeded to extract the file. I manually copy pasted the text into a .TXT file.  Then, I converted the file into the VPL file you can download in the present repository, using python scripts, and bash scripts, so the conversion is not manual and faster and systematic. If anyone want to attemp such thing, I suggest you use CURSOR AI to help you with this process. If you do not have any backgroup in programming, that will certainly be a challenge for you. That is why I provide the VPL file, so you don`t have to go through that process.

The VPL file can be used, in conjunction with "Simple Bible Reader 5.6.2" (or any other converter) to produce a bible module in another format, like Zefania, or BBLI, BBLX, or SWORD, so that you can use it in your own software (Xiphos, BibleTime, or else), locally on your computer.

Why the Fillion?
================
Jerome, in 405, translated the greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. He was perfectly bilingual Latin(native)/Koine Greek(advanced level). He was also immersed in the greek and latin culture, making him a very special translator of the Greek and Hebrew texts. Abbe Fillion was also very proficient in Latin. The catholic church preserved that language over the centuries. Using the Fillion bible in your readings might allow you to discover or understand nuances that modern translations from the Massoretic text might hide, despite the fact that the Fillion bible is a translation of a translation.

I hope you will enjoy your new Fillion bible module for eSword.
Greetings!
Phil
